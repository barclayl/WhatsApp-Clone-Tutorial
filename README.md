Whatsapp Clone is an open-source tutorial that will guide you through step-by-step on how to create a full-stack,
mobile, hybrid web application.

The software world is evolving quickly, and oftentimes people find themselves left behind, even the most experienced ones.
The purpose of this tutorial is to completely demystify the confusion, and be the main guide on how to do things properly.

This tutorial is for anyone who has ever asked himself or herself one of the following questions or similar:

- How do people build an app today?
- What are the “hottest”, most leading technologies currently in the ecosystem?
- What are the best practices for using technology XXX?
- What is the purpose of technology XXX?
- How does technology XXX work?
- How do I use technology XXX?
- How do I migrate to the new version of technology XXX?
- Why should I use technology XXX over technology YYY?

All of the above and more can be answered in the tutorial. Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate or a professional,
we will have the answers you’re looking for.

**What technologies does Whatsapp Clone uses?**

Currently, Whatsapp Clone uses:

- [React (with Hooks and Suspense)](http://react.com)
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com)
- [GraphQL Code Generator](http://graphql-code-generator.com)
- [GraphQL Modules](https://graphql-modules.com)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
- [GraphQL Inspector](https://graphql-inspector.com/)

The point of this tutorial is not to be bound to a certain technology, but rather keep itself aligned with the ecosystem.
When a new technology comes out, and it’s better and more popular, Whatsapp Clone will upgrade to use it (together with full migration instructions).

**P2P tutorial for the community by the community**

What better way would it be to keep Whatsapp Clone aligned with the ecosystem than letting the community maintain it?
Rather than just us dictating what technologies will be used in the app or how the tutorial will be written, we are all going to decide together how things are gonna be.
That’s why we made it open source:

- [Whatsapp Clone - Client](https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-Client-React/tree/step-by-step-final)
- [Whatsapp Clone - Server](https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-server/step-by-step-final)

We’ve also made sure to publish some important documents so you can get more involved. You can track our progress and comment your suggestions, since everything is based on Google Docs and is updated live:

- [Chapter manuals] (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ITxOniS_S3sgZfunLvtJ1L9P6Fj1YOLlFHhoQPjT3S0)

**Migration instructions included**

There are many great tutorials out there, but almost none of them shows you what changes you should make in your app in order to be aligned with a new version of a certain technology.
As technologies are being updated by the minute, some changes are minor and insignificant, but often times a breaking change will be made in which case we need to know how we can adapt to that change.
Thanks to the [Tortilla platform](https://tortilla.academy), we can provide you with a git-diff that will show you what changes were made between each and every released version of the Whatsapp Clone tutorial since the beginning of history.
This way you can easily notice the changes in APIs and migrate your app in no time.

**Prerequisites**

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- JSX
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.JS

OS operations such as navigating to a folder, or creating a folder, are all gonna be written in Bash, but the instructions are OS agnostic and can be applied on any machine that is web-compatible.
